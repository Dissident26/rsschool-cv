         My goal is to study JavaScript and become middle developer in a year maximum.
          Unfortunately I've got lack of expirience in this sphere, but i'm eager 
          to study new things, JS especialy. Hope this course provide me nice adventure
          to world of JS.
        <br>I finished Belarussian National Technical University with "Business in
          Internet" speciality, as a matter of fact I have met hte HTML developing 
          there. 
        <br>My English is good enough, due I've studied it for about 17 years, and
          got need to use it on my current job from time to time. In addition
          I've studied some German, but it is vey insufficient for conversation.
