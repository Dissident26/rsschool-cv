My goal is to study JavaScript and become middle developer in a year maximum. Unfortunately i've got lack of expirience in this sphere, but i'm eager to study new things, JS especialy. Hope this courses provide me nice adventure to world of JS.

My English is good enough, due I've studied it for about 17 years, and god need to use it on my current job from time to time. In addition I've studied some German, but it is vey insufficient for conversation.
